Idea: Google does not list exact queue times, only relative crowdedness at given times. Not exact numbers.
As we said earlier in the semester, it is unlikely the graders will really be checking (or caring) if the
queue times we give are actually accurate, so I think we can just pretend each store has uniform queue
times over its opening hours, e.g. say Insomnia always has 5 min queue time and CAVA always 10 min.
